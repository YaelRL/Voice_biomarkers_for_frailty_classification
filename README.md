# Voice_biomarkers_for_frailty_classification
This project analyzed speech recordings and extracted voice and speech biomarkers that were correlated to frailty syndrome in older adults.

Background: Clinicians use the patient’s voice intuitively to evaluate general health and frailty. Voice is an emerging health indicator but has been it was scarcely studied 
in the context of frailty. This study explored voice parameters as possible predictors of frailty in older adults.
Methods: 53 Participants over 70 years old were recruited from rehabilitation wards at a tertiary medical center. Participants' frailty was assessed using Rockwood frailty 
index and they were classified as most-frail (n=33, 68%) or less-frail (n=20, 32%). Participants were recorded counting from 1 to 10 and backwards using a smartphone recording 
application. The following voice biomarkers were derived: peak and average volume, peak/average volume ratio, pauses’ total length and pause length standard deviation.
Results: The most-frail group had a higher peak volume/average volume ratio (p=0.03) and greater variance in lengths of pauses between speech segments (p=0.0020). 
These parameters indicate greater speech irregularity in the most-frail, compared to the less-frail. The most-frail group also had a longer total duration of pauses (p=0.02).
No statistically significant difference was found in peak and average volume (p=0.75 and 0.39).
Conclusions: Most-frail participants’ speech had different characteristics compared to participants in the less-frail group. This is a first step to developing an AI-based 
frailty assessment tool that can assist in identifying our most vulnerable patients.
